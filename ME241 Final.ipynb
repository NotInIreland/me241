    "In this code, we are addressing solving beam deflection values. This involves taking certain types of forces on a beam, translating them into an equation, and integrating that equation to solve the differential equation of slope and deflection. This code has many applications, including becoming a useful assistant in the classroom to check hand-calculated values and ensuring that a beam’s deflection is within design parameters. We are directly solving for a fixed cantilever beam with an intermediate load, a uniformly distributed load, a triangular distributed load, and a moment equation.   \n"

    "To solve this problem, we must start with an equation. Typically, when solving a problem by hand, an equation is found by setting the moment of a cut equal to 0, and then using the resulting forces found as the general equation. To do this in our code, we created a very similar variable, known as “mgiven” in our code. This is our general starting equation, and it changes based on each loading case. For example, in our intermediate loading equation, “mgiven “is -p * (l – x). This equation uses the variables “p” for the force of the load, “l” as the length of the beam, and “x” as the point where the load is on the beam. This is then integrated twice by the “slopecalculate” and “defleccalculate” functions. These functions return the integral or double integral of our “mgiven” with the addition of c1 or c1 + c2. To solve for c1 and c2, we create our boundary conditions in the function “slopeb” and “deflecb”. These functions set x equal to 0 to show that slope and deflection at the fixed point are 0, and then the “c1val” and “c2val” functions solve for the c1 and c2 values. This gives us a fully symbolic equation, which we can then use subs to plug in values, given by inputs of the user or interactive graph. \n",
    "\n",
    "This code also finds the weight of the beam and the  I value of the beam through the use of a data set. This data set was found off the website “engineering toolbox” and shows the dimensions of “American Wide Flange Beams ASTM A6” beams in imperial units. The link to the website is here: https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/american-wide-flange-steel-beams-d_1319.html . We used this data and compiled it into a csv file, which is named “data” in our code. This allows us to choose a beam size such as W 27 x 178 and have the I value and weight per foot values already given to us. We then plug those values into equations, such as “beamweight” or using I as a value in numerically solving for slope or deflection.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Then to visualize the slope, deflection, moment and shear equations matplotlib is used. First, there are four different base graphs that show the applied force being intermediate load, uniformly distributed load, triangular distributed load, and moment load. Then from there a range of x values, based on the length of the beam in Inches are plugged into the previously found equations to give for plots.  "

    "When solving for the deflection and slope equations of the intermediate loading, we find that they equal -l &ast;p &ast;x&ast;&ast;2 / (2 &ast; E &ast; I) + p &ast; x&ast;&ast;3 / (6&ast; E &ast; I) for the deflection, and  -l&ast;p&ast;x/(E&ast;I) + p&ast;x&ast;&ast;2/(2&ast;E&ast;I) for the slope. This is slightly off from the expected value of (-p&ast;x&ast;&ast;2 / 6 &ast; E &ast; I) &ast; (3 &ast; x – a) for deflection and (-p&ast;x / (2&ast;E&ast;I))&ast;(2&ast;l-x), but is still a relatively accurate value. For example, when solving for the W 27 x 178 beam, which has an I value of 555 in^4, with an E value of 29000, and an 8 ft long beam with the load being 8 lbs located at 6 ft out, the calculated value from ClearCals.com was -0.0928in, while our deflection value was -0.146280. This error could be slightly from the fact that we used a beam deflection table to find our I values, and that the calculator may not be perfect, but it is also from our code. To replicate this value in the calculator and code, use L = 8ft, E = 29000psi, A = 52.3 in^2, Ix = 555in^4, Load = 8 lbs at 6 ft. The link for this calculator is here: https://app.clearcalcs.com/freetools/beam-analysis/us . \n",

    "**Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this code can be used to calculate the shear, moment, deflection and slope of cantilever beams, under varying load conditions. Including intermediate load, uniformly distributed load, triangular distributed load, and applied moment. Integration is used to derive equations for the slope and deflection of the beam which then are plotted on a graph if the user chooses. The code produced results close to the expected values found with ClearCals.com, which appears to be from the beam deflection table we used. This program is useful for ensuring beam deflection is within the limits for structural safety and can be used to quickly to give a user important information about a beam. "
